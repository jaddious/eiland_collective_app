<p>Our initial methodology aimed at documenting and cataloguing, through a digital database, the eilands, following a simple workflow:

</p><p>1- Sampling: Referencing moated homesteads on historic maps. Belgium has a number of historic maps drawn with careful detail, scanned, and available online. Once we compiled them in a single geographic database, we spent quite a bit of time panning through them and placing markers on identified eilands.
</p><p>2- Indexing & categorizing: Each sampled eiland was given a random ID number. This was used to identify each island quickly in the database and to assign the appropriate tags for different categories.
</p><p>3- Researching: We cross referenced each sampled site to information gathered from existing publications, archives and interviews we held with local experts.
</p><p>4- Field Work: Collecting data from the field to complement the index. This included studies done in the field (interviews on location, surveys, drawings, drone imagery etc.) but also new samples that we had missed during our sampling, or more rarely some eilands that were not shown on the maps.
</p><p>The entirety of the data collected through this workflow were integrated in an online database that is open to the public. This quantitative and qualitative database was used as the main reference for all our future endeavors.
</p><p>Initialy we were trying to collect the following information on each farm:
