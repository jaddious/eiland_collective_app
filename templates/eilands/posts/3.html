<p>The study of moated sites is quite popular in fields such as archeology and history. As designers, we were interested in sketching a general research framework to understand the local context and state of development of the moated sites of Southwest Flanders, and elaborate accessible design principles and guidelines for future territorial oriented design practices.
</p>

<p>The tradition of establishing moated homesteads and farmsteads can be traced back to the Neolithic period. During Roman times, settlers also used different moat systems to protect and irrigate their lands.
The medieval city of Kortrijk itself was fortified and isolated farms in the countryside had to fend for themselves. They thus developed moats and wall fortifications to protect themselves from intruders. During the Industrial Revolution, Belgium adopted strong policies to counteract the rural exodus and the moated homesteads found themselves slowly but surely integrated in a low density urban fabric. Many of the moated homesteads started to disappear. Most recently, the city turned away from its industrial heritage towards a residential cityscape, developing attractive parks, squares and gardens. Many of these sites, now integrated in the low density urban sprawl, were turned into parks and cultural hotspots.

<p>Before anything, the moat is used as a means to mark off land. But unlike other enclosed solutions like walls or fences, it offers different spatial and environmental opportunities.
</p><p>The water that is collected in the moats retains rain water, and maximises water absorption in the soil. The moat’s water usually resurfaces through a well or a pump somewhere in the center of the eiland for the inhabitant’s own drinking.
</p><p>From the fish in the moat, to the trees, the shrubs and flowers that grow around it, and the birds and kettle that live by it, the water makes way for a thriving ecosystem to develop within and around it. The moats and the soil around them are clearly the most biodiverse ecosystem in the urban context. Furthermore, the surface water helps regulate the temperature of the moated homestead by creating a microclimate.
</p><p>The moats are not only used to keep unwanted visitors out, but also to keep livestock contained. The water and its open space make the enclosure more enjoyable than an obstructing wall.
</p><p>Furthermore, the shrubs and trees that grow around the moats create a living envelope for the moated homesteads: in summer the abundant leaves protect the moated homestead from sunlight, and in winter their fall allows for sunlight to better heat up the inside of the moated homestead.
</p><p>In short, we have found three main historic reasons for the existence of moated sites:
</p><p style="font-weight:600">Defensive: to fend off unwanted visitors,
</p><p style="font-weight:600">Social: to show off the social status of the land owner,
</p><p style="font-weight:600">Water retention: for agricultural and farming production, but also for human provision.
</p><p>More recently, other functions seemed to have been added on:
</p><p style="font-weight:600">Landscaping & Waterscaping: to shape elements of parks & gardens for visitors enjoyment,
</p><p style="font-weight:600">Leisure: for activities such as fishing and picnicking,
</p><p style="font-weight:600">Ecological: giving life to rich ecosystems.
