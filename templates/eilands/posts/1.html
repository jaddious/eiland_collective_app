<p>The Eiland collective is composed of two architects and an experience designer who were brought together during Designregio’s Designers in Residency program of 2020. The initial theme of the brief “The Future of Urban Leisure'' brought our attention to the moated homesteads of Southwest Flanders. For more than a year (2020 - 2021), we researched this urban typology and developed several projects around the heritage we refer to as islands, or “Eilands”.</p>
