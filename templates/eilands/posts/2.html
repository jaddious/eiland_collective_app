<p>Whereas the presence of a moat allows us to qualify a location as a moated site, we also identified other architectural and landscape elements that would recur frequently in many of the sites we surveyed.

<div class="column" style="width:50%"><h2>Bridge</h2>
<p>The bridge is often the only pathway to access the inner land. It is flat to be accessible by the farm animals (cattle, horses, pigs), humans and vehicles at the same time. In this regard, they used to be quite wide; they are often covered by the “poorte”.

<div class="column" style="width:50%"><h2>Bridge</h2>
<h2>Portal or “Poorte”</h2>
<p>Sometimes painted in a bright color , it constitutes the monumental entrance to the farm or homestead. The appearance of the poorte often gave the name to the farm. They are still very influential toponyms with streets, city quarters, businesses, etc... being named after them. Frequently they present a niche with a representation of the Virgin Mary.

<div class="column" style="height:25%">
<img src="{{ url_for('static',filename='eilands/images/chapel.jpg') }}" height='100%'></div>
<div class="column" style="width:50%"><h2>Chapel</h2>
<p>Dispersed across the countryside, between one moated homestead and another, or along the entry path of an moated homestead we can find a chapel or a wayside shrine. These small chapels host a depiction of a saint or a Madonna. They show the religious devotion of the homestead owners and they offer a moment of religious worship to wayfarers. They acted as gathering grounds for different homesteads’ communities once scattered around the countryside

<div class="column" style="height:25%">
<img src="{{ url_for('static',filename='eilands/images/house.jpg') }}" height='100%'></div>
<div class="column" style="width:50%"><h2>Dwellings</h2>
<p>The various buildings on the eilands are mostly arranged in a U or semi-circular shape, defining a wide courtyard around which the farming activities revolve. The buildings that can be found are usually a living block, a workshop and material storage space, and stables or animal shelters. Seldom, one can find types of buildings that pertain to exceptional and monumental uses: summer houses, castles, pastories, etc…

<div class="column" style="height:25%">
<img src="{{ url_for('static',filename='eilands/images/trees.jpg') }}" height='100%'></div>
<div class="column" style="width:50%"><h2>Trees</h2>
<p>Trees have multiple functions. They can be placed on two parallel rows to frame a monumental path that leads to the eiland. They can also be placed in a circle around the moat to provide shade, sound and visual isolation. Many eilands present a “main” tree in the center of the inner land. They are the perfect habitat to host a variety of endemic bird species. The most used species are willows and poplars.

<div class="column" style="height:25%">
<img src="{{ url_for('static',filename='eilands/images/tower.jpg') }}" height='100%'></div>
<div class="column" style="width:50%"><h2>Pigeon Towers or Dovecotes</h2>
<p>Pigeons had multiple purposes in farming life. But, their presence isn’t purely functional, pigeon towers and their ornamental decorations were clear signifiers of the owner’s wealth.
In fact, dovecote can be found only on larger and more monumental homesteads. One of our interviewees mentioned that the number of slot windows for pigeons represented the number of properties assigned to the owner and thus their nobiliar status.
